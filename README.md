# OpenCL basic examples
here is my feeble attempt at learning OpenCL, please don't make fun of me too much :hamburger

## example 00
this example is based off of [this example](simpleopencl.blogspot.ca/2013/06/tutorial-simple-start-with-opencl-and-c.html) (example-ception), but it goes a bit further. In the blogspot example, two 10-element vectors are created and a thread is used for each pair of elements. In this example, 10 threads are spawned but two 100-element vectors are used, and it is shown how to split up a specific number of elements per thread.

## example 01
(**not complete yet**) timing results of large vectors added together on a CPU vs GPU.
